# Easy to run Wings Daemonizer
Cant be bothered to run through all the separate commands? No worries use this script!

### How do i run this?
Its easy! Just run `curl https://fonix.online/repo/wingsdaemon.sh | sh` Once done the wings daemon should be daemonized!

### It didn't work?
Please bare in mind i created this script for ubuntu only so it may not be compatible on any other systems!

### Extra Info
The daemon itself is by no means my work, all credit goes towards the Pterodactyl community!
